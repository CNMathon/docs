# About Flarum

Flarum is a delightfully simple discussion platform for your website. It's fast, free, and easy to use, with all the features you need to run a successful community. It's also extremely extensible, allowing for ultimate customizability.

## Goals

Flarum is the combined successor of [esoTalk](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk) and [FluxBB](https://fluxbb.org). It is designed to be:

* **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. Flarum is built with PHP so it‚Äôs quick and easy to deploy. The interface is powered by [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org), a performant JavaScript framework with a tiny footprint.

* **Beautiful and responsive.** This is forum software for humans. Flarum is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive across platforms, out-of-the-box.

* **Powerful and extensible.** Customize, extend, and integrate Flarum to suit your community. Flarum‚Äôs architecture is amazingly flexible, with a [powerful Extension API](/extend/README.md).

* **Free and open.** Flarum is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Help the Flarum Project

We are not a for-profit company, nor do we charge any license fee. Flarum is [free, open source](https://github.com/flarum/core) software, maintained and governed by volunteers.

üßë‚Äçüíª If you're a developer, consider [contributing to Flarum's core or bundled extensions](contributing.md). This is **the** most efficient way to help Flarum, and your work can have a lot of impact: there are thousands of Flarum sites out there, with millions of total end users.

üß© If there's a feature you're missing, or a theme idea you have, [writing a custom extension](extend/README.md) will make Flarum that much better for you and others.

‚úíÔ∏è If you're experienced in technical writing, your contributions to [our documentation](https://github.com/flarum/docs/issues) could help future users, admins, and developers make the most of Flarum.

üåê If you speak multiple languages, [translation contributions](extend/language-packs.md) could help make Flarum accessible to countless users around the world.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Join [our community](https://discuss.flarum.org) to talk about Flarum development, get help with your instance, or just meet cool people!

üì£ And if you like Flarum, please consider blogging/tweeting/talking about it! More people aware of Flarum leads to more people engaged with Flarum, and therefore more activity, better extensions, and faster development.

Flarum wouldn't be possible without our phenomenal community. If you're interested in contributing, see our [developer contribution](contributing.md) and [other contribution](contributing-other.md) docs for more information.
