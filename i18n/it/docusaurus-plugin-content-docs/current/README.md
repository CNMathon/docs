## Help the Flarum Project

Flarum is [free, open source](https://github.com/flarum/core) software, maintained and governed by volunteers. We rely on community contributions to help us improve and expand Flarum.

üßë‚Äçüíª If you're a developer, consider [contributing to Flarum's core or bundled extensions](contributing.md). This is **the** most efficient way to help Flarum, and your work can have a lot of impact: there are thousands of Flarum sites out there, with millions of total end users.

üß© If there's a feature you're missing, or a theme idea you have, [writing a custom extension](extend/README.md) will make Flarum that much better for you and others.

‚úíÔ∏è If you're experienced in technical writing, your contributions to [our documentation](https://github.com/flarum/docs/issues) could help future users, admins, and developers make the most of Flarum.

üåê If you speak multiple languages, you could [contribute translations](extend/language-packs.md) to could help make Flarum accessible to countless users around the world.

üí∏ The Flarum Foundation doesn't make money off of Flarum, but does have bills to pay. Donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/flarum) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/flarum) are always gratefully received. In the past, we've also been able to support some of our core developers financially, so they could work on Flarum part time. This wouldn't be possible without your financial support.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Join [our community](https://discuss.flarum.org) to talk about Flarum development, get help with your instance, or just meet cool people! If you're experienced with Flarum, you can also help out beginners!

üêõ If there's a bug that's bothering you, or a feature idea on your mind, we can't know about it unless you tell us! We track bugs, suggestions, and future development plans [via GitHub issues](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues). If there's already an issue open, adding likes and (constructive) additional information can be very helpful!

üì£ And if you like Flarum, please consider blogging/tweeting/talking about it! More people aware of Flarum leads to more people engaging with Flarum, and therefore more activity, better extensions, and faster development.

Flarum wouldn't be possible without our phenomenal community. If you're interested in contributing, see our [developer contribution](contributing.md) and [other contribution](contributing-docs-translations.md) docs for more information.
